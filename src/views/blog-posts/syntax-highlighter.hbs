      I discovered <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron.js</a> in 2020 and I instantly 
      fell in love with it! It enables you to build desktop apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
      so it's perfect for web developers looking to diversify.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I'd published <a href="https://coloureyes.herokuapp.com">Coloureyes</a>, I made another
      site for my one of my music projects - <a href="https://ventrebor.herokuapp.com">ventrebor.com</a>.
      This site had multiple pages and included a nice little contact form. I definitely improved my
      Web dev skills working on it, but I wanted to sink my teeth into something more complex.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, I decided to rebuild my C++ IDE using Electron! Because I loved the way that you
      can construct an app OOP style in Qt, tried my hand at using custom HTML components for the
      GUI - it all fit together so well! I even ALMOST completed a 'universal' syntax highlighter!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I say 'ALMOST', I mean that it was working for nearly every scenario, except for some
      recursive situations - namely, JavaScript template strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way I designed it involved configuring the highlighter with a set of rules for a particular
      language, and the highlighter would parse the text in an open editor - applying styles to each
      resulting token, according to the rules for that language. It was probably not very fast
      or intelligent as far as syntax highlighting is concerned, but, basically, it would analyse the
      text from start to finish - character by charater - by testing the current 'token' against all 
      the highlighting rules. If a rule matched, it would add the token to an array, but if it didn't, 
      it would add the current character to the current token, and try again (and again, and again, etc.)
      until a rule matched or found a space. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, some rules stipulated that there must be a lookahead
      sequence (for instance, function calls must consist of an identifier FOLLOWED BY opening and closing
      parentheses), and it get's more complex with escape sequences in strings and such, 
      but that's the essence of how the highlighter operated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's more work to be done on this aspect of the IDE, but I am very proud of my progress!
