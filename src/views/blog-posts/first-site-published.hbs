      Back in 2020, I wanted to learn a front-end framework
      and I chose Vue.js. I'd used a couple of websites for downloading free icons with free 
      choice of colours, and I thought it would be fun to make a few icons and create a similar
      site. So, what I came up with was an application I called 'IconDrawer' (as in a chest of
      drawers).
    </p>
    <p>
      This app included a colour picker that could be used to modify the SVG logos I'd created,
      and the logos were stored in a database that my server controlled using Sequelize. Once the
      logo's colour is chosen, it can be downloaded in either PNG or SVG format.
    </p>

      I decided to defer semester 2 in 2021, because I wasn't really enjoying the course
      I felt like the content was not building on itself into an applicable knowledge
      base, and I was learning more useful skills working on my own projects.
      I ended up taking a few weeks break from programming, but I was suddenly inspired again
      when I was at a bit of a loose end. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I ended up revisiting the code I'd written for IconDrawer, but - alas - the old laptop
      that I'd been using for the project crashed and I lost all the icons! I was going to 
      remake them (and I probably still will at some point), but I thought I'd try something
      a little different using a colour picker. Also, for the next project I would use local storage
      so that I wouldn't have to worry about maintaining a database.

      <a href="https://coloureyes.herokuapp.com">Coloureyes</a> is basically an SPA with which you
      can discover and save colours, and group them into palettes. The colour picker can be switched
      between HEX and RGB mode, and you can easily copy codes for use in design and Web development.
